<h1>Sitereport</h1>
<p> My learning experience of web development module. At first I have found very difficult to learn about this module. Honestly I will tell that previously 
I haven't studied this course earlier. This module is really new to me. I couldn't understand basic use of different tag. Our course module teacher was very 
friendly and helpful. He have made us understand deeply and clearly. He have taught many times about the basic use of different tags because without knowing 
its use how we can use. So, I can say that our course module teacher was very helpful and friendly. Now starting about the web development course firstly our teacher 
have given introduction about webpage, webiste, internet, web development and so on. Then course module has been started with the introduction of github, how to install
and what is it's use. Then staring of the course, Our course module teacher have started with the basic use of HTML tags. Like use of div tag, section, nav, link, p, header,
footer, img, division, div clas, div class id, form, input, input type, br tag and so on. Now coming to CSS properties I have learned many css properties like body, margin, 
padding, width, height, nav section, nav a, main/container, rightside, div.polaroid, div.container, box-shadow, border, media queires, etc. There were many ups and downs I have 
faced during my web development course module as I have said earlier I found very difficult to learn about this module because it was new to me and I couldn't understand 
the use of most of the tags. Slowly, I have practise alot and much more to understand the use of different tags. I have searched many websites, seen youtube videos and consulted 
many seniors to learn detailed information about this module.</p>
<br>
<p> The discussion on the module experience is web development. This module is mainly taught so that we can make website according to the user needs. This module includes the 
basic use of different HTML tags and CSS properties. The course module includes like how can we make website using html tag and css properties. In this module we have also 
learnt about the use of github. The introduction of webpage, website, internet, basic html structure and css properties and so on. </p>
<br>
<p> The development of the website was quite similar because I have made this design with the help of others team memebers. The technical and design of my portfolio site is very attractive 
the user and customer who visit my website. I have made this design decisions because I find this design decision attractive to attract more number of user who visit my portfolio website. 
The font I have used in my website is simple and normal because I have found that simple is the best and easiest way to attract the user. The color I have used in my website is linear-gradient 
as I found that this color has suited my website to attract more number of user who views my website. I have been influenced by many of the websites. Here is the link of some of the websites are 
<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/creative/2020/03/best-portfolio-websites/">Influenced Website.</a> I have also taken help from different websites. The link for one of them is 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"> W3Schools.</a> I have taken help from my university slides beacause I found easiest way to learn more. </p>
<br>
<p> My website of report include different sections like home page, porfolio page, contact page, blog page and sitereport page. I have taken normally 15 to 20 days to complete my websites. In home 
page I have included nav bar, photo, and introduction of myself. The porfolio page include my work image for my portfolio websites. The contact form includes the form so that if the user had any 
problems regarding my websites they can contact me through this form. The blog page includes the different phases I have faced during my making of porfolio websites. The last page sitereport page includes 
all the detailed information about my portfolio website. How I have made this websites and why I have made this websites.</p>
<br>
<p>I haven't made many changes in my portfolio websites. I have made slightly changes as I have changed my nav bar because using this nav bar I couldn't make my websites responsive. Here is the image of my previous made nav bar.
